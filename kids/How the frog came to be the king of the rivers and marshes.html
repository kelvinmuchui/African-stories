<h1>How the frog came to be the king of the rivers and marshes</h1>

<p>There was a time when animals and people lived on the earth harmoniously side by side. Each respected the other, and they went out of their way to be friendly and useful to each other.</p>
<p>The elephant being the King of the animals decided one day that there should be a King of the Rivers and Marshes. He thought it would be useful to have somebody responsible for alerting people to the coming of the first rains, so that they would have time to get ready and start preparing their tools and seeds.</p>
<p>The king of the animals sent out his trusted town cryer, the cockerel, with a message that any animal who wished to be considered should attend the King’s court the following morning. The cockerel dutifully made his way all round the animal village, passing the King’s messages to all and sundry. The next morning the elephant came into his court yard after having partaken of his breakfast, and found a number of candidates for the post had gathered there. The cat was there, and the monkey. Toad and frog stood side by side, flamingo was there and the crab had also turned up. </p>
<p>The elephant inspected each one of the candidates, and started weighing up their qualities for the position.

To the cat he said: “Cat, you don’t even like water. You run away and hide at the first sight of rain. How can I make you the king of Rivers and Marshes?” So the cat was dismissed.

To the monkey he said: Monkey, I am very happy to see you here, but you are so playful and forgetful, I am afraid you might forget your duties because you always put playing first. I can’t consider you for the position”. So monkey was dismissed.

To the flamingo he said: Flamingo, you would be very good for the post, you love being in the river, but I am afraid your voice just is not loud enough. Nobody would hear you! I can’t make you the king of rivers and marshes. So flamingo was dismissed.

To the Crab he said: My dear Crab. How could I make you the King?. You don’t even have a head! Where would we put your crown? You can’t be the king of the Rivers and Marshes, I’m afraid.” So crab was dismissed. </p>
