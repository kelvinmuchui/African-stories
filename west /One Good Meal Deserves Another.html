<h1>A<em> Tale from West Africa</em></h1>
</p>


<p>
Anansi the Spider hated to share!  When Turtle came to his house at 
mealtime, he said, "I can't give you food until you've washed your dusty
 feet!"
</p>

<p>
Turtle licked his lips when he saw the big plate of steaming food, but 
politely walked to the stream to wash.  When he returned, the plate was 
empty.  "Good meal," Anansi said, patting his full stomach.
</p>

<p>
"One good meal deserves another!" said Turtle.  "Come to my house for 
dinner tomorrow."  Turtle fixed a fine dinner at the bottom of the 
river.  "Come on down and eat!" he said.
</p>

<p>
Anansi filled his jacket pockets with stones so that he would be 
weighted down enough to stay at the river's bottom and eat.  "It's 
impolite to wear a jacket to dinner!" Turtle said, "Take it off!"
</p>

<p>
But when greedy Anansi took off his jacket, he floated back up to the 
surface of the water and hungrily watched Turtle eat his fill!
