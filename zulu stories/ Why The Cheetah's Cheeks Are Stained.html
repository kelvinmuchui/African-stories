		<h1>Why The Cheetah's Cheeks Are Stained (A Traditional Zulu Story)</h1>

<p>
"Kwasuka sukela...."
</p><p>
Long ago a wicked and lazy hunter was sitting under a tree.  He was 
thinking that it was too hot to be bothered with the arduous task of 
stalking prey through the bushes.  Below him in the clearing on the 
grassy veld there were fat springbok grazing.  But this hunter couldn't 
be bothered, so lazy was he!  He gazed at the herd, wishing that he 
could have the meat without the work, when suddenly he noticed a 
movement off to the left of the buck.  It was a female cheetah seeking 
food.  Keeping downwind of the herd, she moved closer and closer to 
them.  She singled out a springbok who had foolishly wandered away from 
the rest.  Suddenly she gathered her long legs under her and sprang 
forward.  With great speed she came upon the springbok and brought it 
down.  Startled, the rest of the herd raced away as the cheetah
quickly killed her prey.
</p>
<p>
The hunter watched as the cheetah dragged her prize to some shade on the
edge of the clearing.  There three beautiful cheetah cubs were waiting 
there for her.  The lazy hunter was filled with envy for the cubs and 
wished that he could have such a good hunter provide for him.  Imagine 
dining on delicious meat every day without having to do the actual 
hunting! Then he had a wicked idea.  He decided that he would steal one 
of the cheetah cubs and train it to hunt for him.  He decided to wait 
until the mother cheetah went to the waterhole late in the afternoon to 
make his move. He smiled to himself.
</p>
<p>
When the sun began to set, the cheetah left her cubs concealed in a bush
 and set off to the waterhole.  Quickly the hunter grabbed his spear and
 trotted down to the bushes where the cubs were hidden.  There he found 
the three cubs, still to young to be frightened of him or to run away.  
He first chose one, then decided upon another, and then changed his mind
 again.  Finally he stole them all, thinking to himself that three 
cheetahs would undoubtedly be better than one.
</p>
<p>
When their mother returned half-an-hour later and found her babies gone,
 she was broken-hearted.  The poor mother cheetah cried and cried until 
her tears made dark stains down her cheeks.  She wept all night and into
 the next day. She cried so loudly that she was heard by an old man who 
came to see what the noise was all about.
</p>
<p>
Now this old man was wise and knew the ways of the animals.  When he
discovered what the wicked hunter had done, he became very angry.  The 
lazy hunter was not only a thief, he had broken the traditions of the 
tribe. Everyone knew that a hunter must use only his own strength and 
skill.  Any other way of hunting was surely a dishonour.
</p>
<p>
The old man returned to the village and told the elders what has 
happened. The villagers became angry.   They found the lazy hunter and 
drove him away from the village.  The old man took the three cheetah 
cubs back to their grateful mother.  But the long weeping of the mother 
cheetah stained her face forever.  Today the cheetah wears the 
tearstains on its face as a reminder to the hunters that it is not 
honourable to hunt in any other way than that which is traditional.
