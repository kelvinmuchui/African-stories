		<h1>Where Stories Come From (A Traditional Zulu Story)</h1>

<p>
Once, a very long time ago, so long ago that it must have been close to 
the time when the First Man and the First Woman walked upon the earth, 
there lived a woman named Manzandaba  (mah-nzah-ndah'-bah) and her 
husband Zenzele (zay-nzay'-lay).  
</p><p>
They lived in a traditional home in a small traditional
village.  They had many children, and for the most part, they were very
happy.  They would spend the day working, weaving baskets, tanning 
hides, hunting and tilling the earth near their home.  On occasion they 
would go down to the great ocean and play under the sun in the sand, 
laughing at the funny crabs they would see scuttling along there and 
rejoicing at the way in which the birds would dip and dive in the sea 
breezes.  Zenzele had the heart of an artist and loved to carve.  He 
would fashion beautiful birds out of old tree stumps.  With his axe he 
could make the most wonderful impala and kudu bucks from stone.  Their 
homestead was filled with decorative works by Zenzele the carver.
</p><p>
But in the evenings when the family would sit around the fire before 
going to sleep they would not be so happy.  It was too dark for weaving 
or carving, and yet too early to go to sleep.  "Mama," the children 
would cry, "Sifuna izindaba!" (see-foo'-nah   ezee-ndah'-bah)  "We want 
stories!  Tell us some stories, Mama!"  Manzandaba would think and 
think, trying to find a story she could tell her children, but it was of
 no use.  She and Zenzele had no stories to tell.  They sought the 
counsel of their neighbours, but none of them knew any stories.  They 
listened to the wind.  Could the wind be trying to tell them a story?  
No, they heard nothing.  There were no stories, no dreams, no magical 
tales.
</p><p>
One day Zenzele told his wife that she must go in search of stories.  He
promised to look after the home, to care for the children, to mend and 
wash and sweep and clean, if only she would bring back stories for the 
people. Manzandaba agreed.  She kissed her husband and children good-bye
 and set off in search of stories.
</p><p>
The woman decided to ask every creature she passed if they had stories 
to share.  The first animal she met was Nogwaja (noh-gwah'jah) the hare.
  He was such a trickster!  But she thought she'd better ask him all the
 same. "Nogwaja, do you have any stories?  My people are hungry for 
tales!" "Stories?" shrieked Nogwaja.  "Why, I have hundreds, thousands, 
no--millions of them!"
</p><p>
"Oh, please, Nogwaja," begged Manzandaba, "give some to me that we might be happy!"
</p><p>
"Ummm...." Nogwaja said.  "Uhhhh...well, I have no time for stories now.
Can't you see that I am terribly busy?  Stories in the daytime, indeed!"
And Nogwaja hopped quickly away.  Silly Nogwaja!  He was lying!  He didn't have any stories!
</p><p>
With a sigh Manzandaba continued on her way.  The next one she came upon
 was mother baboon with her babies.  "Oh, Fene! (fay'-nay) " she called.
  "I see you are a mother also!  My children are crying for stories.  Do
 you have any stories that I could bring back to them?"
</p><p>
"Stories?" laughed the baboon.  "Do I look like I have time to tell 
stories? Hawu!  With so much work to do to keep my children fed and safe
 and warm, do you think I have time for stories?  I am glad that I do 
not have human children who cry for such silly things!"
</p><p>
Manzandaba continued on her way.  She then saw an owl in a wild fig 
tree. "Oh, Khova (koh'-vah)," she called, "please will you help me?  I 
am looking for stories.  Do you have any stories you could give me to 
take back to my home?"
</p><p>
Well, the owl was most perturbed at having been woken from her sleep.  
"Who is making noise in my ears?" she hooted.  "What is this disruption?
  What do you want?  Stories!  You dare wake me for stories?  How rude!"
 And with that the owl flew off to another tree and perched much higher,
 where she believed she would be left in peace.  Soon she was sound 
asleep again.  And Manzandaba went sadly on her way.
</p><p>
Next she came upon an elephant.  "Oh, kind Ndlovu (ndloh'-voo)," she 
asked, "do you know where I might find some stories?  My people are 
hungry for some tales, and we do not have any!"
</p><p>
Now the elephant was a kind animal.  He saw the look in the woman's eye 
and felt immediately sorry for her. "Dear woman," he said, "I do not 
know of any stories.  But I do know the eagle.  He is the king of the 
birds and flies much higher than all the rest.  Don't you think that he 
might know where you could find stories?"
</p><p>
"Ngiyabonga, Ndlovu!" she said.  "Thank you very much!"
</p><p>
So Manzandaba began to search for Nkwazi (nkwah'-zee) the great fish 
eagle. She found him near the mouth of the Tugela River.  Excitedly she 
ran toward him.  She called out to him as he was swooping down from the 
sky, talons outstretched to grab a fish from the river.  "Nkwazi!  
Nkwazi!"  she called.
She so startled the eagle that he dropped the fish that had been his.  
He circled around and landed on the shore near the woman.
</p><p>
"Hawu!" he barked at her.  "What is so important that you cause me to lose my supper?"
</p><p>
"Oh, great and wise Nkwazi," began Manzandaba.  (Now fish eagle is very
vain.  He liked hearing this woman refer to him and great and wise.  He
puffed out his feathers as she spoke.)  "Nkwazi, my people are hungry 
for stories.  I have been searching a long time now for tales to bring 
back to them.  Do you know where I might find such tales?"  She gave him
 a great look of desperation.
</p><p>
"Well," he said, "even though I am quite wise, I do not know everything.
  I only know of the things that are here on the face of the earth.  But
 there is one who knows even the secrets of the deep, dark ocean.  
Perhaps he could help you.  I will try and call him for you.  Stay here 
and wait for me!" So Manzandaba waited several days for her friend the 
fish eagle to return. Finally he came back to her.  "Sawubona, 
nkosikazi!" he called.  "I have returned, and I am successful!  My 
friend, ufudu lwasolwandle, the big sea turtle, has agreed to take you 
to a place where you can find stories!"  And with that the great sea 
turtle lifted himself out of the ocean.
</p><p>
"Woza, nkosikazi," said the sea turtle in his deep voice.  "Climb onto 
my back and hold onto my shell.  I will carry you to the Land of the 
Spirit People."  So the woman took hold of his shell and down they went 
into the depths of the sea.  The woman was quite amazed.  She had never 
seen such beautiful things before in her life.  Finally they came to the
 bottom of the ocean where the Spirit People dwell.  The sea turtle took
 her straight to the thrones of the King and Queen.  They were so regal!
  Manzandaba was a bit afraid at first to look at them.  She bowed down 
before them.
</p><p>
"What do you wish of us, woman from the dry lands?"  they asked.
</p><p>
So Manzandaba told them of her desire to bring stories to her people.  
</p><p>
"Do you have stories that I could take to them?" she asked rather shyly.
</p><p>
"Yes," they said, "we have many stories.  But what will you give us in
exchange for those stories, Manzandaba?"
</p><p>
"What do you desire?" Manzandaba asked.
</p><p>
"What we would really like," they said, "is a picture of your home and 
your people.  We can never go to the dry lands, but it would be so nice 
to see that place.  can you bring us a picture, Manzandaba?"
</p><p>
"Oh, yes!" she answered.  "I can do that!  Thank you, thank you!"
</p><p>
So Manzandaba climbed back onto the turtle's shell, and he took her back
 to the shore.  She thanked him profusely and asked him to return with 
the next round moon to collect her and the picture.
</p><p>
The woman told her family all of the things she had seen and experienced
 on her journey.  When she finally got to the end of the tale her 
husband cried out with delight.  "I can do that!  I can carve a 
beautiful picture in wood for the Spirit People in exchange for their 
stories!"  And he set to work straight away.
</p><p>
Manzandaba was so proud of her husband and the deftness of his fingers. 
 She watched him as the picture he carved came to life.  There were the 
members of their family, their home and their village.  Soon others in 
the community heard about Manzandaba's journey and the promised stories 
and came also to watch Zenzele's creation take shape.   When the next 
round moon showed her face Zenzele was ready.  He carefully tied the 
picture to Manzandaba's back. She climbed on the turtle's back and away 
they went to the Spirit Kingdom. When they saw the picture the King and 
Queen of the Spirit people were so happy!  They praised Zenzele's talent
 and gave Manzandaba a special necklace made of the finest shells for 
her husband in thanks.  And then they turned to Manzandaba herself.  
"For you and your people," they said, "we give the gift of stories."  
And they handed her the largest and most beautiful shell she had ever 
seen.  "Whenever you want a story,"  they said, "just hold this shell to
 your ear and you will have your tale!"  Manzandaba thanked them for 
their extreme kindness and headed back to her own world.
</p><p>
When she arrived at the shore, there to meet her was her own family and 
all the people of her village.  They sat around a huge fire and called 
out, "Tell us a story, Manzandaba!  Tell us a story!"
</p><p>
So she sat down, put the shell to her ear, and began, "Kwesuka sukela...."
</p><p>
And that is how stories came to be!
